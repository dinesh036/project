You can customize your cygwin terminal to show you git branches, commit 
changes, etc.
There are many plugins you can used, but i want to to introduce to you 
an specific python script can help you to watch your git repo and you 
can add its features using unix PS1 enviroment reset as per your 
requirements.

YOU CAN FIND [VCPROMPT] TO GOOGLE

Steps i follow:
1. clone git repo from git@github.com:djl/vcprompt.git
2. copy content of bin to your home/bin
3. open .bashrc file
4. add PATH='~/bin:$PATH'
5. add PS1='\[\e]0;\w\a\]\n\[\e[1;32m\u@\h \e[1;33m\w \e[1;36m$(vcprompt 
-f '%b%m%u')\e[0m\n\$'
6. restart you terminal and you are done.

You can customize PS1 value as you like, in my configuration let me 
explain to you what are values.
1. \[\e]0;\w\a] are copied from /etc/bash.bashrc file.
2. \n for insert new line.
3. \[ just ignore square brace, its don't have any meaning.
4. \e[1;32m is an color value of green.
5. \u is user name information tracer for terminal.
6. @ is an string formating used.
7. \h is host machine name information tracer for terminal.
8. added space.
9. \e[1;33m is a color value for yellow.
10. \w is working directory information tracer for terminal.
11. added space.
12. \e[1;36m is a color value.
13. $() is used for extra command access from terminal in bash script, 
vcprompt is our program and -f is for passing formated string as 
argument %b denotes branch name of git repo, %m denotes 
added changes in added files on stage its show + sign, %u 
tells us whether there is any unstage file in git repo or 
not its show ? sign.
